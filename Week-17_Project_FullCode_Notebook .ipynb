        "An automobile dealership in Los Vegas specializes in selling luxury and non-luxury vehicles. They cater to diverse customer preferences with varying vehicle specifications, such as mileage, engine capacity, and seating capacity. However, the dealership faces significant challenges in maintaining consistency and efficiency across its pricing strategy due to reliance on manual processes and disconnected systems. Pricing evaluations are prone to errors, updates are delayed, and scaling operations are difficult as demand grows. These inefficiencies impact revenue and customer trust. Recognizing the need for a reliable and scalable solution, the dealership is seeking to implement a unified system that ensures seamless integration of data-driven pricing decisions, adaptability to changing market conditions, and operational efficiency."

This job script accepts one input: the path to the trained model (model). The script begins by loading the model using the `mlflow.sklearn.load_model()` function. Afterward, it registers the model in the MLflow model registry, assigning it a descriptive name (`used_cars_price_prediction_model`) and specifying an artifact path (`random_forest_price_regressor`) where the model artifacts will be stored. Using MLflow's `log_model()` function, the model is logged along with its metadata, ensuring that the model is easily trackable and retrievable for future evaluation, deployment, or retraining."

This job plays a crucial role in the pipeline by ensuring that the best-performing model identified during hyperparameter tuning is systematically stored and made available in the MLflow registry for further evaluation, deployment, or retraining. Integrating this job into the end-to-end pipeline automates the process of registering high-quality models, completing the model development lifecycle and enabling the prediction of used car prices."
