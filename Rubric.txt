Criteria
Building an end-to-end MLOps Pipeline in AzureML Studio
- Create a MLOps pipeline in AzureML Studio containing the following components
    - data preprocessing
    - model training
    - model tuning and logging using MLflow
    - model registration
- Register all the above components into a single pipeline
- Execute the pipeline

Dear Learner
The solution cannot be followed in detail so a resubmission is required with all the sections clearly differentiated and also the screenshots of the pipeline and workflow clearly added and observations being added in all sections so please look into the rubric and work on the same structured section flow for evaluation

Criteria
Create a GitHub Actions Workflow with the necessary Python scripts and YAML files
- Download and modify (if needed) the relevant Python scripts (.py files) created previously for the different components of the MLOps pipeline
- Create the necessary YAML (.yml) files required for the GitHub Actions worflow
- Put the Python scripts and YAML files in a hierarchical folder structure
